## What I am building and why it matters

I am building a Bitcoin-native, proof-gated messenger on top of Bram Kanstein’s LOCK protocol. That is the intention. Not a toy, not a novelty, but a tool that lets people share secrets where access is earned by a concrete action on Bitcoin. If you want Bram’s source of truth, the repo [lives here](https://github.com/bramkanstein/lock-protocol) and he is [@bramk](https://x.com/bramk) on X. My role is to turn that protocol into something you can actually touch, then push on it until the design either holds up or shows us where it has to evolve.

The motivation is simple. Services fade. Domains change hands. Moderation rules drift. Yet private coordination is something humans will always need. I want a messenger that can survive the life and death cycle of companies because it does not depend on their permission in the first place. LOCK protocol gives a Bitcoin-native way to do that. Make a message a sealed, portable artifact. Attach a short rule that defines what counts as a valid unlock. Require a real transaction on chain that proves the rule was met before anything decrypts. No accounts. No usernames. No trusted server in the middle asking you to believe its marketing. Just a proof and a key.

## The lens Bitcoiners already know in their bones

Bitcoiners live by proofs. We already prefer signatures to slogans. We already accept that finality has a cost and that the cost is what makes the promise believable. LOCK asks us to carry those instincts forward as expressed through private messaging. You do not read a secret because a server knows your name. You read it because you produced a transaction that satisfies a rule the sender defined. That rule can be minimal or it can express intent. Pay this much. Pay within this range. Do it after this block height. Only allow it to happen a limited number of times. When the unlock confirms, the client derives the key and opens the sealed payload. Until then, nothing leaks.

This is a small mental shift with big ripple effects. Identity stops being the first-class object. The server stops being the gate. The incentive sits in the unlock itself. You can pass the sealed file however you want. Email, USB, QR, a shared folder, a relay of your choice. The artifact is the conversation, not the cloud service. That is a different physics model than most people are used to, and it is exactly why I think it's compelling.

## Explaining to myself, to figure it out

Here is the human flow. I write you a message and choose your Bitcoin address as the intended reader. I click Seal. The app encrypts the content into a compact container and writes down the access rules. It offers me a PSBT to sign so I can bind the vault with a small on chain breadcrumb if I want provenance and a timestamp. After I sign, it hands me a big export action that never hides. I send the sealed file however I want. On your side, you drop the file into your client. It reads the rule, constructs an unlock transaction that satisfies it, and waits. When the block lands, the proof is real, and your client opens the message. If you reply, you repeat the same ritual in reverse. We keep passing sealed artifacts back and forth. No one asks a service to vouch for us.

You feel the weight of it. There is a pause while a block is mined. There is a fee. The UI can be friendly, but the underlying rhythm is slower than the dopamine loops we are used to. That is the point. The time you wait is not an accident. It is the cost that buys finality. The fee you pay is not a tax on convenience. It is the price of a proof the other side can verify in a decade without depnding on an intermediary. When I lean into that, the quiet becomes reassuring. There is no simulated trust here. There is a rule, a ledger, and the satisfaction of opening something you actually earned the right to read.

## What it is not, and what it replaces

This is not a competitor to Signal for daily chatter. Signal is excellent. It gives you transport privacy and a very smooth delivery experience. It also ties your life to a service that must keep operating and must obey the politics of wherever its infrastructure sits. That is not a criticism. It is just reality. LOCK aims at a different axis. When you care more about independence and auditability than presence bubbles, the proof-first style starts to look sane.

It also is not just rebranded PGP. PGP removes the server from the trust path, but it still attaches access to identity. That can be enough until identity becomes the pressure point. With LOCK the unlock does not ride on a social claim. It is priced in energy. You either met the rule or you did not. There is room in the world for both models. As a Bitcoiner, it is healthy to have a tool that speaks our native language.

If you squint at Nostr, you can see a nice complement. Nostr is a public event fabric built on relays. LOCK is a private unlock fabric built on Bitcoin. You can float a sealed payload through Nostr if that suits you. The access decision remains local and tied to a proof. Delivery becomes a choice, not a dependency.

## Utility that may become obvious

Once you accept that unlock equals proof, a set of patterns get simple. A one time paid note becomes straightforward to explain to a non technical person. You can say, the message opens after a payment that I will be able to verify forever. Time locked reveals feel natural. Put a block height into the rule and the note is literally not openable until the chain reaches that moment. First contact filters stop being platform gimmicks. If you want a stranger to put a little skin in the game before you invest time, the rule enforces that without asking a company to play bouncer. Shared custody becomes boring in the best way. A few wallets are authorized, and the moment one of them performs the unlock, the secret opens for them and a local log records that the unlock was used.

The part I keep returning to is portability. Portable secrets are underrated. They give you continuity. They let conversations survive the shutdown of products. They help in places where platforms are not friendly or where connectivity is partial. They let teams compose their own delivery method without denting the security story. That is not just a technical property. It is a cultural stance that says we do not put our private life behind the health of a single company.

## Costs we probably should embrace

Latency, fees, and privacy tradeoffs are not bugs in LOCK, they are the cost of rooting access in Bitcoin’s finality. If you want real finality, you wait for a confirmation and you ignore replaceable transactions. If you want a proof anyone can verify in ten years, you pay a fee. If you want sane privacy, you encrypt metadata by default, use fresh addresses, prefer amount ranges over weird fingerprints, and think carefully about binding. If absolute privacy is your only goal, this is not the tool. If independence and verifiability matter more, you accept the footprint and make it as small and thoughtful as possible. Do not hide any of this behind convenient UI/UX. So: time, cost, and tradeoffs are part of the deal.

## Why absolute privacy isn’t possible here

LOCK makes access depend on on-chain events. That is the superpower and somewhat of a limiter. Bitcoin’s ledger is transparent by design, so unlocks and optional bindings leave observable traces: amounts, timing, and addresses exist forever and can be correlated. Even with encrypted metadata, fresh addresses, Tor, and careful coin control, an outside observer can still do potential graph analysis, timing analysis, wallet-fingerprint heuristics, or other shit I barely understand. The distribution channel for sealed files can leak patterns too, so: file timing, size, and who sent what to whom. You can reduce the surface with good defaults and habits, but you cannot erase it without giving up the very thing that makes LOCK credible: a public proof that the rule was satisfied.

## Where Lock as a protocol could shine

Every time I continue to pass through the use case flow, the same strengths show up, even if it takes this repitition for me to ingrain what this means. The rule surface is small and clear. The reliance on PSBT and external signing is crucial. It gives us hardware wallet support, air gapped flows, and a path for people who refuse to let a web app hold keys. The verification list is short enough to turn into a public test suite that other clients can run. That is how you keep security honest without inventing a central authority. And then there is the stubborn fact that sealed artifacts are just files. History is kind to simple file formats. They outlive super extravegant proprietary dribble.

There is also a cultural fit that matters. The Bitcoin crowd respects minimalism and proof more than theater. LOCK leans into that. I _think_ it refuses to comfort you with an account page. It asks for an action and rewards you with a result you can verify in a decade. When a tool lines up with the culture of its users, it has a chance to last.

## Some random rambling tech questions that need attention

Specs get better when we stress them. The metadata path needs to be clear and testable across clients. Sign to decrypt is the right idea, but we should fix the challenge format, name the KDF settings, and publish test vectors so wallet teams can check behavior without guesswork. Binding needs straight guidance. When do you put a timestamp on chain, when do you avoid the footprint, and how does rebinding keep the original amount rule while handing off ownership?

Authorized wallet lists will hit real needs fast. Teams want 2 of 3. Families want a backup key that activates after a height. Taproot and MultiSig should arrive eventually. If we do not define a few standard patterns that cover most cases, we will get a mess of one offs. Replay and unlock accounting are not glamorous, but they matter. People use more than one device. Make the counter portable with a small signed record you can move between machines. Small edges like this cut users first.

The social side needs care. A naive client that pushes odd, unique amounts makes correlation easy. Good defaults help. Fresh change destinations. Sensible ranges. Clear warnings when an action will create a recognizable pattern. We cannot stop adversaries from trying, but we can stop bad software from helping them.

## What comes next?

Bram started this conversation with LOCK. Credit where it is due. The protocol is his idea and again can be [found here](https://github.com/bramkanstein/lock-protocol). I am bringing a builder’s stubbornness to the table because I want to see where the friction really lives. I'm trying to play devil's advocate but the more I study the utility of this idea the more convinced I become. I would really appreciate feedback from people who live and breathe Bitcoin, who know the sharp edges of privacy tradeoffs, who can spot weak defaults from across the room. Any cryptography experts who might be willing to lend an eye (I'm an experienced amatuer).

I am aiming to put a testable demo in your hands soon. A thing you can run and critique. When it is ready, I will ask you to try to break it and tell me where the UX needs to grow up and where the protocol needs more precision. The goal is to ship a working experiment that grabs the attention of people who care fervently about verifiability layers on this gift we call Bitcoin.
